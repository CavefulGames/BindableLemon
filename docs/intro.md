# Introduction

## What's LemonSignal
LemonSignal is a pure Luau signal implementation with huge performance improvements and new features like variadics and the ability to reconnect a preaviously disconnected connection using `:Reconnect`.
More on those features on the next page.

## API Design
LemonSignal uses the conventional Roblox signal and connection so you can easily swap it with any other Luau signal that uses that API like [GoodSignal](https://github.com/stravant/goodsignal) and immediately enjoy the new features and improvements.
